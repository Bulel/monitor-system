monitor downloading of system, after download txt file, delete it;
It will write all log into monitorlog.txt;

pip install pypiwin32 on windows, not win32gui;

I put it in the startup, so I do not need to run it after start my PC;
Also, it will minmize it self after startup;

Create a shortcut of the script, then mv it to "C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\";
